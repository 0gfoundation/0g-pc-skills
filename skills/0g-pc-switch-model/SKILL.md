description: Switch which 0G Private Computer model Claude Code uses in this project, among the models the 0G router (router-api.0g.ai) actually serves in Anthropic format. Use when the user wants to change, switch or pick a different 0G model for a project that is already on 0G. Triggers include "换模型", "换个模型", "切到 glm-5.3", "换成别的 0G 模型", "switch 0G model", "change the 0G model", "use a different 0G model", "which 0G models can I use". Not for first-time setup and not for turning 0G off.

# Switch the 0G model for this project

This skill does one thing: change which model `<project>/.claude/settings.json` points at.

It does not install, and it does not uninstall. If the user wants either, say so and stop —
`/0g-pc-setup` and `/0g-pc-uninstall` are the ones, and doing their job from here produces a
half-configured project that looks finished.

## Hard rules

1. **Never write `~/.claude/settings.json`.** The user's global file holds their hooks, plugins,
   status line and `/model` choice. Read it if you need to; write only
   `<project>/.claude/settings.json`.
2. **Do not touch the permission gate.** `modelOverrides["claude-sonnet-5"]` must stay on
   `0gm-1.0-35b-a3b`. In auto mode the safety classifier resolves through the **Sonnet** tier, not
   Haiku; point it at a reasoning model and every Bash, git and network call times out with
   "temporarily unavailable" while chat keeps working — which reads as "model fine, tools broken"
   and sends people looking in the wrong place. `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` and
   `fallbackModel` are likewise left alone; both are deliberately pinned to the fast model.
3. **Nothing takes effect until the next launch.** Finish by telling the user to restart. Never
   say the running session is now on the new model — it is not, and `/model` cannot get it there.
4. **Every place the user has to decide is a tool call, not a sentence.** This file is loaded into
   whatever model is driving the session, which in a project on 0G is a 0G model rather than
   Claude. A written instruction like "let the user choose" is read as narration and walked
   straight past. Use AskUserQuestion and let it block. This is the defect that made the skill
   this one was split out of non-interactive.

## 0 — The one precondition

```bash
test -f .claude/settings.json && echo present || echo absent
```

`absent` means this project is not on 0G at all, so there is no model to switch. Say that, point
at `/0g-pc-setup`, and stop. Do not install anything from here.

This is a precondition, not a mode decision: the skill's job never changes based on what it finds
on disk. It either does that job or refuses to start.

## 1 — Ask the router what it serves

```bash
curl -s https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/models | python3 -c "
import json,sys
rows=[m for m in json.load(sys.stdin)['data'] if 'anthropic' in (m.get('supported_formats') or [])]
if not rows: sys.exit('router returned no anthropic-format model - stop and report')
for m in sorted(rows, key=lambda x:-(x.get('context_length') or 0)):
    v=m.get('verifiability') if m.get('tee_attested') else None
    tee={'TeeML':'TEE, model in enclave','TeeTLS':'TEE, proxied upstream'}.get(v,'NO TEE')
    a=m.get('architecture') or {}
    img='text+image' if 'image' in (a.get('input_modalities') or []) else 'text only'
    print(f\"{m['id']:22} ctx={m.get('context_length'):>8}  {tee:22} {img}\")"
```

Never offer a model that is not in this output. A model the router serves in `openai` format only
cannot be reached by this config at all — it is a direct connection, with nothing in between to
translate. If the endpoint is unreachable, stop and report; do not fall back to a list written
down somewhere, which is how a model that was retired last month ends up recommended today.

Read the three TEE tiers out loud and **do not merge them**. They are different promises:

| Column | What it means |
|---|---|
| `TEE, model in enclave` | The model runs inside the enclave and signs its responses. The strongest guarantee on offer. |
| `TEE, proxied upstream` | The enclave terminates TLS and forwards to an upstream provider. The connection is attested; the model's own execution is not. |
| `NO TEE` | Ordinary hosted inference. |

Someone may be choosing a model precisely because of that column. Flattening it to "TEE ✓" tells
them something false about where their prompt gets processed.

Mention the `text only` / `text+image` column too. A text-only main model cannot take an image at
all — `fallbackModel` does not rescue that, because it fires on the router being overloaded, not
on the request being the wrong shape.

## 2 — Let the user pick, and wait

Put the models from step 1 to the user with **AskUserQuestion**, carrying the context length, the
TEE tier and the image column into what they see. Then stop.

**Write nothing until the answer comes back.** Not the config, not a draft, not "I'll assume
glm-5.3 for now". If an argument was passed (`/0g-pc-switch-model glm-5.3`), that is the answer
and this step is already done — go to step 3 without asking.

If the user names a model the router serves in `openai` format only — `kimi-k3` and `glm-5.2` are
the ones people ask for — say plainly that a direct config cannot reach it, point at
[the reference](https://github.com/0gfoundation/0g-pc-skills/blob/main/docs/claude-code.md#openai-only-models-need-the-bridge),
and **stop there**. Do not start building a local translation layer inside this conversation. That
path exists and is documented; it is not this skill.

## 3 — Rewrite the four fields together

Replace `TARGET` with what the user chose, and run it:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, pathlib, sys, urllib.request

TARGET = "glm-5.3"          # ← the user's choice

with urllib.request.urlopen("https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/models", timeout=15) as r:
    live = {m["id"]: m for m in json.load(r)["data"]}
m = live.get(TARGET)
if m is None:
    sys.exit(f"{TARGET} is not on the router right now - check the list again")
if "anthropic" not in (m.get("supported_formats") or []):
    sys.exit(f"{TARGET} speaks {'+'.join(m.get('supported_formats') or ['no'])} only; "
             "a direct config cannot reach it. Pick one from the step 1 list.")

p = pathlib.Path(".claude/settings.json")
cfg = json.loads(p.read_text())          # fails loudly rather than clobbering
env = cfg["env"]
for k in ("ANTHROPIC_MODEL", "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL", "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL"):
    env[k] = TARGET
ceiling = m["context_length"] * 15 // 16
env["CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS"] = str(ceiling)

text = json.dumps(cfg, indent=2) + "\n"
json.loads(text)                          # validate before touching disk
p.write_text(text)
print(f"{TARGET}  context {m['context_length']}  ceiling {ceiling}")
PY
```

Four fields, one write. Three of them name the model; the fourth is the context ceiling, and it
has to move with it. Leave it at a larger model's value and nothing fails until the session grows
long — an error hours later, with nothing visibly connecting it to this switch.

The model name and the ceiling both come from the router in the same call that validates the
choice. Neither is typed into this file: a model name written down here would outlive its presence
on the router and turn every switch into a confident report about a model that is gone.

## 4 — Confirm, then hand off

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0gfoundation/0g-pc-skills/main/check-0g.sh | sh
```

Silence is the pass. It reads the effective model, the permission gate and the context ceiling,
and says nothing when all three agree.

Then tell the user to restart Claude Code, and to run `/status` afterwards to see the Model line.
The running session keeps the old model: `/model` switches tiers inside a session, but it cannot
reach a 0G model name — the client rejects the name before any request leaves the machine — so a
restart is the only way through.

## When it goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| Auto mode: "… is temporarily unavailable, cannot determine the safety of …" | Read the model named in the message. If it is `0gm-1.0-35b-a3b`, the gate was changed — put `modelOverrides["claude-sonnet-5"]` back (hard rule 2). If it is the model just switched to, the Sonnet tier resolved to nothing and the classifier fell back to the main model. |
| That message names a model ending in `[1m]` | The session model carries a 1M-context tag and Claude Code copied it onto the derived classifier, asking the router for an ID it does not serve. Pick the non-1M entry with `/model`. |
| Long sessions fail hours after a switch | The ceiling did not move with the model. Re-run step 3 rather than editing the number by hand. |
| The switch appears to do nothing | The old session is still running, or `claude` was launched from a different directory — project config is scoped to the folder holding `.claude/settings.json`. Also check `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is loaded after it and wins. |
| 402 from the router | The key is valid and the account is empty. Nothing in the config needs changing — top up at https://pc.0g.ai/dashboard/overview |
