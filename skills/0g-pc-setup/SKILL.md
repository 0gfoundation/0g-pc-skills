description: Put a project on 0G Private Computer (pc.0g.ai, router-api.0g.ai) as Claude Code's model backend — TEE-backed inference reached through an Anthropic-compatible router. Use when the user wants to set up, connect or start using 0G in a project for the first time. Triggers include "接入 0G", "配置 0G", "把 Claude Code 接到 0G", "用 0G 的模型", "0G 怎么配", "set up 0G PC", "connect Claude Code to 0G", "put this project on 0G", "use 0G models in Claude Code". Not for changing models afterwards and not for turning 0G off.

# Put this project on 0G

One job: get `<project>/.claude/` configured so Claude Code talks to the 0G router.

The installer does the writing. What this skill adds is the decision in front of it — which model,
and on what basis — plus the two things people get wrong afterwards.

## Hard rules

1. **Never write `~/.claude/settings.json`.** The user's global file holds their hooks, plugins,
   status line and `/model` choice. Read it if you need to; everything installed here goes inside
   `<project>/.claude/`.
2. **The key never enters the conversation.** You do not ask for it, receive it, read it out of a
   file, or put it on a command line you run. Hand the user the command and let *them* paste their
   own key into their own terminal. If they paste a key into the chat anyway, tell them to rotate
   it at pc.0g.ai — it is now in a transcript.
3. **You do not run the installer.** It takes the key as an argument, so running it is the user's
   step, not yours. Hard rule 2 is why.
4. **Do not touch the permission gate.** The shipped config points
   `modelOverrides["claude-sonnet-5"]` at `0gm-1.0-35b-a3b`. In auto mode the safety classifier
   resolves through the **Sonnet** tier, not Haiku; put a reasoning model there and every Bash, git
   and network call times out with "temporarily unavailable" while chat keeps working — which
   reads as "model fine, tools broken".
5. **Every place the user has to decide is a tool call, not a sentence.** This file is loaded into
   whatever model drives the session. "Let the user choose", written as prose, reads as narration
   and gets walked past. Use AskUserQuestion and let it block.

## 0 — The one precondition

```bash
test -f .claude/settings.json && echo present || echo absent
```

`present` means this project is already configured. Do not reinstall over it: say so, and point at
`/0g-pc-switch-model` if what they actually want is a different model, or `/0g-pc-uninstall` if
they want out. Reinstalling to change a model throws away a key for no reason.

This is a precondition, not a mode decision — the job never changes with what is on disk, the
skill either does it or refuses to start.

## 1 — Ask the router what it serves

```bash
curl -s https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/models | python3 -c "
import json,sys
rows=[m for m in json.load(sys.stdin)['data'] if 'anthropic' in (m.get('supported_formats') or [])]
if not rows: sys.exit('router returned no anthropic-format model - stop and report')
for m in sorted(rows, key=lambda x:-(x.get('context_length') or 0)):
    v=m.get('verifiability') if m.get('tee_attested') else None
    tee={'TeeML':'TEE, model in enclave','TeeTLS':'TEE, proxied upstream'}.get(v,'NO TEE')
    a=m.get('architecture') or {}
    img='text+image' if 'image' in (a.get('input_modalities') or []) else 'text only'
    print(f\"{m['id']:22} ctx={m.get('context_length'):>8}  {tee:22} {img}\")"
```

Only what this prints can be reached. A model the router serves in `openai` format only needs a
local translation layer, which is [a different setup](https://github.com/0gfoundation/0g-pc-skills/blob/main/docs/claude-code.md#openai-only-models-need-the-bridge)
and not this one. If the endpoint is unreachable, stop and report — do not fall back to a list
written down somewhere, which is how a model retired last month gets recommended today.

Read the three TEE tiers out loud and **do not merge them**. They are different promises:

| Column | What it means |
|---|---|
| `TEE, model in enclave` | The model runs inside the enclave and signs its responses. The strongest guarantee on offer. |
| `TEE, proxied upstream` | The enclave terminates TLS and forwards to an upstream provider. The connection is attested; the model's own execution is not. |
| `NO TEE` | Ordinary hosted inference, with the privacy properties of any hosted API. |

This column is the reason someone is here. Flattening it to "TEE ✓" tells them something false
about where their prompt gets processed — and TEE is what they are paying for.

Mention `text only` / `text+image` as well. The shipped default is text-only: it cannot take an
image at all, and `fallbackModel` does not rescue that, because it fires on the router being
overloaded rather than on the request being the wrong shape.

## 2 — Let them choose, and wait

Put the list to the user with **AskUserQuestion**, carrying context length, TEE tier and the image
column into what they see. Recommend the shipped default, `glm-5.3` — TEE with the model in the
enclave, the largest context among those, text only — but present it as the default, not as the
answer.

**Write nothing and suggest no command until the answer comes back.**

## 3 — Hand them the command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0gfoundation/0g-pc-skills/main/install.sh | bash -s claude --key sk-…
```

Tell them, in this order:

1. **Run it from the project they want on 0G.** It writes into that folder and nowhere else, so
   the directory is the one thing that matters.
2. **Replace `sk-…` with their own key**, from pc.0g.ai → Dashboard → API Keys. This is their step;
   hard rule 3.
3. **`--key -` prompts for the key instead**, with echo off, so it stays out of shell history.
   Worth mentioning to anyone who shares a machine or keeps history in a synced dotfile.
4. It writes `.claude/settings.json` (no credentials, safe to commit) and
   `.claude/settings.local.json` (the key, mode 600, git-ignored), keeps any `settings.json`
   that was already there as `settings.json.0g-backup`, and checks the key against the router
   before reporting success — so a rejected key says so immediately instead of surfacing later as
   a failure to start.

If their chosen model is not the shipped default, they install first and then run
`/0g-pc-switch-model <model>`. **Do not rewrite the model fields from here.** That rewrite has one
owner, and duplicating it in two skills is how the two drift apart.

## 4 — Hand off

Restart Claude Code, then `/status`: the Base URL should read `https://router-api.0g.ai`. The
startup line `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` is expected and harmless — Claude Code does not
know 0G's model names.

To confirm the parts that are easy to get wrong:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0gfoundation/0g-pc-skills/main/check-0g.sh | sh
```

Silence is the pass.

## When it goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `Not logged in · Please run /login` | The project has a 0G config but no usable credential. **`/login` does not fix this** — it authenticates against Anthropic, and that token is useless once the base URL points at 0G. Re-run the installer so the key lands in `settings.local.json`. |
| 401 | The router rejected the key. Check it at pc.0g.ai → Dashboard → API Keys. A 401 also takes down the auto-mode classifier, so fix it before diagnosing anything about tools. |
| 402 | The key is valid and the account is empty. Nothing in the config needs changing — top up at https://pc.0g.ai/dashboard/overview |
| Auto mode: "… is temporarily unavailable, cannot determine the safety of …" | Read the model named in the message. A `[1m]` suffix means the session model carries a 1M-context tag that Claude Code copied onto the derived classifier; pick the non-1M entry with `/model`. Otherwise the permission gate was changed — hard rule 4. |
| The config seems ignored | Claude Code was launched from a different directory. Project config is scoped to the folder holding `.claude/settings.json`. Also check `.claude/settings.local.json`, loaded after it and winning. |
